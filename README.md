# neural-network
 Neural Network implemented from scratch using NumPy and Pandas. Allows variable number of hidden layers and learning rate.

# Description
 Project taken from my Data Mining projects repository. The network utilizes linear algebra to quickly perform feed-forward and backpropagation functions, and allows for variable amount of epochs/amount of hidden layers/learning rate.
